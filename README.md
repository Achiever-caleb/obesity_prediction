# **Optimizing Classification Models with Ensemble Methods**

## **Overview**
This project illustrates the creation of an ideal classification model through the use of different machine learning algorithms and a combined methodology. The employed models consist of **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree Classifier**, **Random Forest Classifier**, **Support Vector Classifier**, and a **Voting Classifier** to leverage their advantages. The aim of using ensemble methods is to improve model performance, attain superior generalization, and reduce misclassifications.



## **Project Objectives**
1. To explore and evaluate multiple classification algorithms for a given dataset.
2. To leverage the power of ensemble methods to combine individual model predictions for improved accuracy.
3. To analyze model performance using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**.



## **Approach**
1. **Model Selection**:
   - Implemented individual models such as:
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **Decision Tree Classifier**
     - **Random Forest Classifier**
     - **Support Vector Classifier**
   - Combined models using a **Voting Classifier**:
     - **Hard Voting**: Majority class prediction.
     - **Soft Voting**: Weighted probability-based prediction.

2. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.
   - **Precision & Recall**: To balance false positives and false negatives.
   - **F1-score**: To evaluate the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: To analyze classification errors.

3. **Ensemble Learning**:
   - Combined predictions of individual models using the Voting Classifier.
   - Analyzed the performance boost achieved through ensembling.



## **Results**
The **Voting Classifier** demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of **96.5%**, surpassing individual model accuracies. Key observations include:
- High precision, recall, and F1-scores across most classes.
- Improved performance in handling class imbalances compared to standalone models.
- Reduction in misclassifications, especially for complex or overlapping classes.
